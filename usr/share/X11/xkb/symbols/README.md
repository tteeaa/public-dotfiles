### This is an edited version of the GB (UK layout), which I now call the 'EURO layout'
The EURO layout is toggled using SHIFT+ALT (in hyprland config), with the US being the default.

Some changes may seem redundant, as they can be achieved with AltGr, but my main keyboard does not have this key.

This keymap mainly caters to using the SHIFT key for special characters instead of being a usable alternative layout. (One cannot type a,o,u,s in this keymap)
